# Thingworx_RESTCALLS
Send data from ESP8266 to Thingworx using REST calls

After strugling for days, finally came across with REST calls for Thingworx. Made sample program for PUT and GET Request for Particular
property in Thingworx. Using this "get.txt" code, we can fetch exact value of a Property and use it as a Trigger for Sensors which are connected to ESP8266 
or do something with that data. Using "put.txt" code, we can send exact data to Property in Thingworx, Here i am giving it manually, but we can 
send data read by a sensor.
